        <h2>5 Best Places to Visit in Afghanistan:</h2>
        <ol>
        <strong><li class="Afg-cities">Kandahar</li></strong>
        
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Aerial_photograph_of_Kandahar_Province_in_2011.jpg/1200px-Aerial_photograph_of_Kandahar_Province_in_2011.jpg" alt="A picture from the top of the Kandhar" width="500">
            
       
         
         <p id="Afghanistan-places-heading"><strong>The revered home of the Mosque of the Sacred Cloak and a city steeped in history</strong>,<em> Kandahar</em> sits at the crossroads where southern<em> Afghanistan</em> meets the mountains of the country’s heartland.

<strong>The traditional seat of Pashtun power, it was the capital of the last<em> Afghan</em> empire during the years of Ahmad Shah Durrani</strong>.

<br>Today, the place is filled with<em> mosques</em>,<em> shrines</em>, and<em> mausoleums</em> to luminaries from the national past, and folk come to see<strong> the curious inscriptions of the great Mughal invader Babur on the Chilzina View, located just on the edges of the city</strong>.</p>

        
            <strong><li class="Afg-cities">Mazar-e Sharif</li></strong>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Main_mosque-Mazar-2012.jpg" alt="Main mosque-Mazar"  width="500">
        
        
        <p id="Afghanistan-places-heading"><strong>The cobalt domes of the great Blue Mosque shoulder their way above the skyline of<em> Mazar-e Sharif</em></strong>, glowing white-hot under the scorching<em> Balkh</em> sun.

<strong>Famed as the burial site of<em> Ali bin Talib</em>, the cousin of the Prophet<em> Mohammad</em> himself</strong>, it’s a gorgeous array of arabesque and south<em> Asian</em> architecture, complete with turquoise-blue domes and gold-peppered minarets.

However,<strong> the <em>Muslim</em> history is just one aspect of<em> Mazar-e Sharif</em></strong>, because this city is <strong>also home to countless<em> Greek</em> relics</strong>; ones that found their way here with<strong>the coming of Alexander’s armies in the 3rd century BC!</strong></p>


       
           
           <strong><li class="Afg-cities">Herat</li></strong>
           <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Herat_Congregational_Mosque_-Afghanistan.jpg" alt="Herat Congregational Mosque" width="500">
       
       
       <p id="Afghanistan-places-heading">It’s easy to see why<strong><em> Herat</em> – the third-largest city in<em> Afghanistan</em></strong> – has such a <em>Persian</em> flavor to it: the town sits just a stone’s throw from the <em>Irania</em> border, and <strong>it was once the home of the Timurid dynasty</strong> (a lineage that fused elements of <em>Turkic</em>,<em> Persian</em> and<em> Mongol</em> culture in their time).<br>
       <strong>The great piece de resistance of the city is The<em> Friday Mosque</em></strong>.

This elegant structure of turquoise-tipped minarets and shimmering tiles is sure to wow the senses – it’s thought to be<strong> more than eight centuries old</strong>! <br><strong>There’s also the<em> Herat</em> Citadel to see, and the tombs of revered Sufi poets.</strong></p>


        <strong><li class="Afg-cities">Samangan</li></strong>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Samangan_Province_panorama_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Samangan Province panorama" width="500" height="150">
        
        
        <p id="Afghanistan-places-heading"><strong>.While the town of <em>Samangan</em> is an ancient caravan stop on the periphery routes of the<em> old Silk Road</em></strong>, that claim to fame isn’t actually it’s major draw.<br>

That honor goes to the mysterious cave complexes of <em>Takht i Rostam</em> that carve their way through the dusty ridges of the mountains nearby.<br>

These are thought to have been built in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, and are adorned with gorgeous <em>Buddhist</em> inlays of lotus leaves, all focusing on an inner mud-brick stupa.<br>

<strong>They offer an immersive glimpse into an almost-forgotten, pre-Muslim past</strong>.</p>




             <strong><li class="Afg-cities">Panjshir</li></strong>
             <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Buildings_in_Panjshir_Province%2C_Afghanistan.JPG" alt="Buildings in Panjshir Province" width="500">
             
             
             
         <p id="Afghanistan-places-heading"><strong>Carving its way into the foothills of the<em> Hindu Kush</em> from the eastern provinces of<em> Afghanistan</em>, the<em> Panjshir Valley</em> is tipped to become one of the newfound industrial powerhouses of the nation.</strong><br>

<strong>With<em> American</em> investment taking the lead</strong>, talk of everything from emerald mining to hydroelectric generation is being floated for these parts.<br>

However, for the time being, <em>Panjshir</em> remains the glorious medley of snow-topped mountains and winding rivers, verdant fields and rustic hamlets its always been – except, that is,<strong> when the <em>Soviets</em> rolled this way during their invasion in the 1980s.</strong></P>
